"Been on a downhill slide for a while. Tonight was the tail in the coffin for me.

Customer service is bull. You go in during return department hours, and are told that the guy running returns is on lunch, but that‚Äôs okay, since it‚Äôs gunna close in 6 minutes the night. Why do you schedule the associates lunch at the end of the day? When we ask if we can get someone else that can return here, there was a whole lot of trash talk from the associates in checkout saying it wasn‚Äôt their job. thankfully Aden, jumped in to help us without murmuring, like the other associates. And apologized for the other associates behavior.

Self checkout was a complete flop. Why am I not getting an employee discount if I have to scan my owns stuff. Now Anchorage and other places are stealing from self checkout; so they pulled self checkout without getting enough Associates. Congratulations, now your 5 minute run to Walmart is a 45 min one.
Icing on the cake today, I walked in and a lot of their stuff is behind glass, why is workout gear, legos, and flashlights locked up. This isn‚Äôt Anchorage. We can control ourselves no need to tell us what we can buy.

"The Walmart in Ketchikan, Alaska, offers a unique shopping experience, distinct from many of the chain‚Äôs typical mainland locations. Located at 4230 Don King Road, this store serves as a vital retail hub for both locals and visitors to the area. Given Ketchikan‚Äôs geographical isolation, the store plays an essential role in providing access to a wide range of products, from groceries and household items to electronics and outdoor gear.

One of the notable aspects of the Ketchikan Walmart is its ability to stock items that cater specifically to the needs of the local community and the influx of tourists. The store carries a variety of fishing equipment, rain gear, and other outdoor necessities, reflecting the town's reputation as a gateway to the Alaskan wilderness. This consideration for local demand sets the store apart and demonstrates Walmart‚Äôs adaptability to regional needs.

The layout and organization of the store are consistent with the familiar Walmart model, ensuring ease of navigation for regular customers. Despite its remote location, the store maintains a clean and well-organized environment, with aisles that are generally free of clutter and well-stocked shelves. The employees are often noted for their friendliness and willingness to assist, which enhances the overall shopping experience.

However, due to Ketchikan's remote location, there are occasional issues with stock shortages and delays in the arrival of new products. This can be somewhat frustrating for shoppers who rely on the store for their regular supplies. Additionally, prices at this Walmart tend to be higher than those at mainland locations, a reflection of the additional shipping costs required to transport goods to this remote part of Alaska.

Overall, the Ketchikan Walmart is a crucial retail resource for the community, providing a wide array of products tailored to local needs and maintaining a high standard of customer service. Despite minor inconveniences related to stock and pricing, the store remains a reliable and well-regarded establishment in the region.",walmart ketchikan alaska offers unique shopping experience distinct many chains typical mainland locations located king road store serves vital retail hub locals visitors area given ketchikans geographical isolation store plays essential role providing access wide range products groceries household items electronics outdoor gear one notable aspects ketchikan walmart ability stock items cater specifically needs local community influx tourists store carries variety fishing equipment rain gear outdoor necessities reflecting towns reputation gateway alaskan wilderness consideration local demand sets store apart demonstrates walmarts adaptability regional needs layout organization store consistent familiar walmart model ensuring ease navigation regular customers despite remote location store maintains clean wellorganized environment aisles generally free clutter wellstocked shelves employees often noted friendliness willingness assist enhances overall shopping experience however due ketchikans remote location occasional issues stock shortages delays arrival new products somewhat frustrating shoppers rely store regular supplies additionally prices walmart tend higher mainland locations reflection additional shipping costs required transport goods remote part alaska overall ketchikan walmart crucial retail resource community providing wide array products tailored local needs maintaining high standard customer service despite minor inconveniences related stock pricing store remains reliable wellregarded establishment region,0.0698961038961039

"Not a happy camper! My cart was full with Xmas gifts and goodies for Xmas dinner, so it was a big order. I began by giving the clerk my tax exempt card. I was in the tobacco line and I  had a package of lighters which I gave to him next and requested a carton of smokes. He said great, no problem. He put the lighters and smokes on the counter and began ringing my order up. I began loading the counter and transferring the bagged goods to an empty cart. I paid for my order, took it to my vehicle and drove home. When I got home and was putting things away, it became obvious there were no cigarettes or lighters in the bags. When done with unbagging, I went to my vehicle to drive back out to Walmart for the lighters and cigs.  Lucky me with a 28 year old vehicle-it decided it wouldn't start. Nothing I  could do about it at 8:30 p.m. on a Friday night.  I ended up walking to Safeway for  pack of smokes in the pouring rain.

"They don't always answer the phone, in any of the extension; but I had success today with the pharmacy and bakery. The operator wouldn't answer, nor electronics, the auto section, or human resources. This is extremely frustrating. I bought a prepaid ATT cellphone in late July, with unlimited data. This is proven in my receipt, which is in my possession, but the employee, who was new, gave me limited data, and he failed to give me my six digit pin number, which has led to many problems. There is no pin number in my paper work. I had to go into a corporate office to resolve these issues. Now they have employees scanning our items at the check-out, I believe to desensitize us to more corporate control and tyranny. I believe they want us to feel like helpless prisoners. Also, too many items behind glass. The music is too loud, and the type of music is bad. They allow dogs, which are filthy, and carry germs, ticks and fleas. I believe all of this is an attack on America, to demean us. People should also know that you own the receipt. There are no laws stating that you must show a receipt. This is purely optional. Recently I was in the hardware section, and asked an employee to unlock the glass, so I could get an item. He said he would be right back, but didn't return (at least not for the several minutes I waited). I pushed the button for assistance, but no one came.

I always use the self checkout because the live cashier is busy helping people who need tobacco or over the age of 18 products. Their prices are way higher than WinCo which I absolutely love. The only reason I shop at Walmart is because I can't get all my gluten free items in one place. WinCo use to be top dog for all my go to gluten free products not anymore. I know that the self check out scanners cause issues or the ones who run it cause issues because they think I'm stealing. This happens every time I shop here. I could see it happening once in awhile but every freaking time I shop. I don't dress like a bum and it shouldn't matter if I did. It's the mask I tell you it must be a target for criminal behavior. Well I'm not a criminal and I say this every time I leave the store. Walmart if I had stole from you I wouldn't be allowed in your stores plus I would be convicted.

"I'm completely upset with the Walmart store on Stony Plain Rd in Edmonton. They point blank refuse to honour their own store policies. Today I attempted to purchase a single item of Lysol Toilet Bowl Cleaner. The item was stacked next to a 4-pack of the same item. The bar code from my receipt is 005963177922. This item scanned as a 4-pack when I clearly had 1 item in my cart. Long story short I was charged $12.47 for an item that was listed for 3 dollars and change.

I saw the mistake on my receipt and brought the item to the Customer Service desk. It is my understanding that with an error of this nature you give me the item for free. The lady would not do that nor would she listen to my explanation. She kept insisting that the item scanned correctly when it clearly didn't. I demanded my money back - left the item there and left the store. I should have returned my entire purchase.

I called you store by phone and asked for the Store manager - I got what I think was the same person that I dealt with at the store - She identified herself as Nancy. After much debate she agreed to give me the single item for free but only if I could return to the store while she was there. When I said that I would be in the area this afternoon. She instead asked that I come back the next day or on the weekend. Why I don't know - I guess she's the only person that works there.

At this point in time she has my name and number and is to be calling me back. I'm not holding my breath waiting for a phone call.

I filled out a survey and explained all of this online - this is their  response.

"There was a time when the abundance of self-checkout lanes greatly enhanced the efficiency of our shopping experience. However, the significant reduction of these lanes, for reasons that remain baffling, has introduced a host of challenges.

The most notable impact has been the substantial increase in wait times. Where customers previously enjoyed swift checkouts within 2-3 minutes, they are now faced with prolonged delays of 10-15 minutes due to the limited number of available lanes and the apparent shortage of staff. This inefficiency is both inconvenient and frustrating for customers.

It is perplexing why so many self-checkout lanes were removed, especially considering their clear benefits. Restoring these lanes would greatly improve the overall shopping experience by reducing wait times and increasing operational efficiency.",time abundance selfcheckout lanes greatly enhanced efficiency shopping experience however significant reduction lanes reasons remain baffling introduced host challenges notable impact substantial increase wait times customers previously enjoyed swift checkouts within minutes faced prolonged delays minutes due limited number available lanes apparent shortage staff inefficiency inconvenient frustrating customers perplexing many selfcheckout lanes removed especially considering clear benefits restoring lanes would greatly improve overall shopping experience reducing wait times increasing operational efficiency,0.20803571428571427

Long story short , I'm AuDHD , physically disabled with CPTSD & PTSD types 2-4. I was profiled , ambushed, touched , harassed , followed , accused of stealing and damaging property. Two women disguised as customers surrounded me in a very small aisle. Once I realized what was going on , I felt threatened , confused , in danger & overwhelmed . I had no clear path to leave. Since this event , I have been having PTSD panic attacks , anxiety attacks , burn out and meltdowns on off for months. I'm still scared to shop at other stores.

The behavior of several employees here is disgusting. I've been : surrounded by 4+ employees multiple times for coming in with my own property (backpack to carry my groceries, my winter goat / gloves I took off due to being hot) , been chased / accused of stealing items I bought there weeks ago. I'm sick and tired of being accused of shoplifting here & being followed for wearing a mask despite the recent pandemic.

Stay safe and untraumatized my spicy autistic friends.

Dear Walmart , DO . BETTER . You can start off by PAYING YOUR EMPLOYEE'S MORE and then MAYBE they wouldn't hate their job so much and take it out on innocent , vulnerable people.

And since Walmart never got back to me, I've included a photo of the women. It's grainy and censored. It could still be helpful to get a general idea of who to avoid.
