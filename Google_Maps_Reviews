"Been on a downhill slide for a while. Tonight was the tail in the coffin for me.

Customer service is bull. You go in during return department hours, and are told that the guy running returns is on lunch, but that’s okay, since it’s gunna close in 6 minutes the night. Why do you schedule the associates lunch at the end of the day? When we ask if we can get someone else that can return here, there was a whole lot of trash talk from the associates in checkout saying it wasn’t their job. thankfully Aden, jumped in to help us without murmuring, like the other associates. And apologized for the other associates behavior.

Self checkout was a complete flop. Why am I not getting an employee discount if I have to scan my owns stuff. Now Anchorage and other places are stealing from self checkout; so they pulled self checkout without getting enough Associates. Congratulations, now your 5 minute run to Walmart is a 45 min one.
Icing on the cake today, I walked in and a lot of their stuff is behind glass, why is workout gear, legos, and flashlights locked up. This isn’t Anchorage. We can control ourselves no need to tell us what we can buy.

"The Walmart in Ketchikan, Alaska, offers a unique shopping experience, distinct from many of the chain’s typical mainland locations. Located at 4230 Don King Road, this store serves as a vital retail hub for both locals and visitors to the area. Given Ketchikan’s geographical isolation, the store plays an essential role in providing access to a wide range of products, from groceries and household items to electronics and outdoor gear.

One of the notable aspects of the Ketchikan Walmart is its ability to stock items that cater specifically to the needs of the local community and the influx of tourists. The store carries a variety of fishing equipment, rain gear, and other outdoor necessities, reflecting the town's reputation as a gateway to the Alaskan wilderness. This consideration for local demand sets the store apart and demonstrates Walmart’s adaptability to regional needs.

The layout and organization of the store are consistent with the familiar Walmart model, ensuring ease of navigation for regular customers. Despite its remote location, the store maintains a clean and well-organized environment, with aisles that are generally free of clutter and well-stocked shelves. The employees are often noted for their friendliness and willingness to assist, which enhances the overall shopping experience.

However, due to Ketchikan's remote location, there are occasional issues with stock shortages and delays in the arrival of new products. This can be somewhat frustrating for shoppers who rely on the store for their regular supplies.

"Not a happy camper! My cart was full with Xmas gifts and goodies for Xmas dinner, so it was a big order. I began by giving the clerk my tax exempt card. I was in the tobacco line and I  had a package of lighters which I gave to him next and requested a carton of smokes. He said great, no problem. He put the lighters and smokes on the counter and began ringing my order up. I began loading the counter and transferring the bagged goods to an empty cart. I paid for my order, took it to my vehicle and drove home. When I got home and was putting things away, it became obvious there were no cigarettes or lighters in the bags. When done with unbagging, I went to my vehicle to drive back out to Walmart for the lighters and cigs.  Lucky me with a 28 year old vehicle-it decided it wouldn't start. Nothing I  could do about it at 8:30 p.m. on a Friday night.  I ended up walking to Safeway for  pack of smokes in the pouring rain.

"First of all, the greeter doesn’t greet. That should tell you everything you need to know about this location. Secondly, when we were at the self checkouts, we were angrily told by a manager that we couldn’t pay for beer there. Ok, no problem, didn’t know that as we’re tourists. I went to a cashier to pay for it while my wife finished settling up at the self checkout.

"It's the typical large size Walmart. Of course they have almost everything that anyone would want. Their selection is beyond anyone's imagination and although they're not always the lowest price on the things that they're not low on, they're very competitive. What else would anyone expect from this retailer. Over all their staff is usually courteous and efficient . They're self-checkout system has improved immensely and I have started to use it routinely if there's not a regular cashier available without waiting in line. I think they should do away with their shopping Cart fee. I know it encourages people to put their carts in the corrals but that doesn't work that efficiently either. Your competition have all done away with the need to put a coin in the cart and their parking lots are as clear as yours. Just a suggestion. Do not another thing I would suggest would be to get a supply of the smaller carts for those people who on some occasions pick up a few items maybe up to 30 or so. You could still get in the small ones and they're much easier to handle and maneuver around the store. 🧢",,4 months ago,0,115294583634354563563,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115294583634354563563?hl=en,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIIGshPahy-ujHzyZW-qU6OCDOSictUBFhGbkAockUoxicJYw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,True,5,[],Google,Edmonton,Alberta,CA,"Department store, Appliance Shop, Baby shop, Electronics Retail and Repair Shop, Home Furniture Shop, Supermarket, School Supply Shop, Toy Shop, Video Game Shop",Walmart Supercentre,3013,53.5387057,-113.6442396

Customer service is good, it won't take long to find a worker who can answer your questions quickly and courteously. A very clean place, as well as the hallways and the bathrooms that you will find in the place. The only problem you may encounter is the parking spaces, you will always find one, but finding one near the entrance is a bit of luck.

"Walmart is walmart. There isn't much to say but when you are so incompetent that you can't even do your job in walmart it needs to be brought up. The automotive center in this walmart is so ridiculously bad that no one should trust it. It seems as though they just hire people off the streets that have seen a car. The worst employee the automotive center has is the old lady that works the cash register. Of course she doesn't wear her badge so I do not know her name. She takes 10 years to do a transaction and she is incredibly rude when you question what she is talking about because it makes no sense when she is talking. Also, if you want your engine to blow get an oil change from these unprofessional workers. They seem to not understand how to seal the oil cap so your left wondering if your oil is leaking.

"I went to this store to pick up a coffee maker that was on sale. When I went to check out, the sale price was not being applied and it was full price. I asked the attendant at the self checkout if they could update the price, and I was told I would have to order the coffee maker online because they would not honor the online price. I either had to place an order for in store pickup, which would have taken 5 days to process, or order it for delivery and wait 4 days to get it. Despite the fact that it was literally the exact same product being sold by Walmart Canada.

"They don't always answer the phone, in any of the extension; but I had success today with the pharmacy and bakery. The operator wouldn't answer, nor electronics, the auto section, or human resources. This is extremely frustrating. I bought a prepaid ATT cellphone in late July, with unlimited data. This is proven in my receipt, which is in my possession, but the employee, who was new, gave me limited data, and he failed to give me my six digit pin number, which has led to many problems. There is no pin number in my paper work. I had to go into a corporate office to resolve these issues. Now they have employees scanning our items at the check-out, I believe to desensitize us to more corporate control and tyranny. I believe they want us to feel like helpless prisoners. Also, too many items behind glass. The music is too loud, and the type of music is bad. They allow dogs, which are filthy, and carry germs, ticks and fleas. I believe all of this is an attack on America, to demean us. People should also know that you own the receipt. There are no laws stating that you must show a receipt. This is purely optional. Recently I was in the hardware section, and asked an employee to unlock the glass, so I could get an item. He said he would be right back, but didn't return (at least not for the several minutes I waited). I pushed the button for assistance, but no one came. I waited several minutes, but it's possible some came after I left.

I use to like Walmart. They absolutely make me feel like I'm a criminal I don't steal my parents taught me better and I use to work retail. These morons think that a person wearing a mask is out to pull one over on the store please I parked in the north 40 and I have a jacked up ACL that's not exactly a thief's mo. Right. I always use the self checkout because the live cashier is busy helping people who need tobacco or over the age of 18 products. Their prices are way higher than WinCo which I absolutely love. The only reason I shop at Walmart is because I can't get all my gluten free items in one place. WinCo use to be top dog for all my go to gluten free products not anymore. I know that the self check out scanners cause issues or the ones who run it cause issues because they think I'm stealing. This happens every time I shop here. I could see it happening once in awhile but every freaking time I shop. I don't dress like a bum and it shouldn't matter if I did. It's the mask I tell you it must be a target for criminal behavior. Well I'm not a criminal and I say this every time I leave the store. Walmart if I had stole from you I wouldn't be allowed in your stores plus I would be convicted.

However, customer service told me that they do not accept this item return since in their system something did not much, even though I had an original receipt and the price is exactly the same as at this location. So, they made me drive to the original Walmart store, where I returned the item with no issues.",,8 months ago,3,101709527753854080833,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101709527753854080833?hl=en,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX4WQ-3bEaBuIzNGNMoYW1vOxQhQSTRndpai9-V_oC9BUeRGsST=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,False,1,[],Google,Edmonton,Alberta,CA,"Department store, Appliance Shop, Baby shop, Electronics Retail and Repair Shop, Home Furniture Shop, Supermarket, School Supply Shop, Toy Shop, Video Game Shop",Walmart Supercentre,3013,53.5387057,-113.6442396

"This store used to be my favorite. You could get almost anything you needed in one trip, but not anymore, everything is locked up.
You can never find anybody with a key when you want something that's locked up. It's ridiculous. I was there on Memorial Day weekend. There was one line open. The cashier was super slow.  The line was long terrible service and where are the self-serve Check outs.  Not everybody is a thief so why not leave the Self serve lines open.  While there over Memorial Day weekend, I wanted to get some asprins and peroxide.  I can't believe that was locked up.  Not one employee around to help me.  I have been shopping more at winco and food maxx.  At least you can get what you need and get out of there instead of waiting in line with one cashier.  Really bad service at Walmart. I have been shopping at Walmart for years. Perhaps if employes were not allowed to talk to each other in the self-serve area and actually watched the customers, Maybe that would help to prevent some thefts and the self serve registers would be open.

"I am not a fan of Walmart most people aren't.
I travel all over the country with strict deadlines then all the small towns that I travel to. I only had about an hour of free time to figure out how I was going to get my extremely important medication refilled while  being states away from home.
It's a Sunday and it can be quite the lengthy process to have prescriptions transferred even from other Walmarts, But I just want to say I have never had such an amazing experience at a Walmart pharmacy.
HEATHER & PENNY were the most kind, quick and professional people I've ever met at ANY pharmacy. Penny quickly jumped into action notifying her pharmacist Heather and team of my issue. Even though it can be a headache they happily worked together efficiently to make sure I was able to get my much needed medication before they close because they knew I had to leave town The next day and would not be able to return nor would I be near any pharmacy where I was traveling to.

"I'm completely upset with the Walmart store on Stony Plain Rd in Edmonton. They point blank refuse to honour their own store policies. Today I attempted to purchase a single item of Lysol Toilet Bowl Cleaner. The item was stacked next to a 4-pack of the same item. The bar code from my receipt is 005963177922. This item scanned as a 4-pack when I clearly had 1 item in my cart. Long story short I was charged $12.47 for an item that was listed for 3 dollars and change.

I saw the mistake on my receipt and brought the item to the Customer Service desk. It is my understanding that with an error of this nature you give me the item for free. The lady would not do that nor would she listen to my explanation. She kept insisting that the item scanned correctly when it clearly didn't. I demanded my money back - left the item there and left the store. I should have returned my entire purchase.

I called you store by phone and asked for the Store manager - I got what I think was the same person that I dealt with at the store - She identified herself as Nancy. After much debate she agreed to give me the single item for free but only if I could return to the store while she was there. When I said that I would be in the area this afternoon. She instead asked that I come back the next day or on the weekend. Why I don't know - I guess she's the only person that works there.

At this point in time she has my name and number and is to be calling me back. I'm not holding my breath waiting for a phone call.

I filled out a survey and explained all of this online - this is their  response.

Dirty bathrooms. Never enough cashiers. And the people that grocery shop for pick up orders do not care. Half the time you don't get what you ordered or the products are damaged from how they throw them together. Also as far as customer service there is none in this store. The employees are not friendly at all and don't help. Except for the door greeters they are the only ones that make it to where you would shop here. If there were better choices in moses lake I would stop shopping here. Also the isles are so narrow you can't even shop without bumping into someone. Then you have walmart employees shopping for the pickup customers and their carts take up most the isle so you have to wait for them.

"This store is going through some transition with regards to their self check, so 90% are closed and I guess won't be reopened, so I guess they'll at some point redo the front of their store.  Secondly,  they are focusing so much on their delivery and pick-up business that you can't navigate an isle as an in store shopper without getting blocked in by these order pickers.  They don't care about blocking isles with their carts when they don't have to, and it's frustrating. Most just don't care about the actual in store shoppers, and many are just rude.  UPDATE:  The store has their self checks open.  I have Walmart + and have had about ten deliveries of groceries so far and they've been perfect.  The shopping experience has improved at the store.

They were all just standing around BEING LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS; just having a great old time, yelling through the store with each other....absolutely not doing a thing, and IGNORING THE CUSTOMERS!  True to character, they were like a gang of non-English speaking INVASIONISTS inside the store, only they were all sporting BRAND NEW ROYAL BLUE WALMART VESTS on!

"It's Gresham, so my standards weren't very high, but this Walmart used to be better. Open the damn Self Checkouts, quit making it for spark drivers only. They only have 5 registers open at any given time if that, but took self checkout away from us?

I also saw a rude security guard nearly body slam somebody because they wouldn't show her their receipt even though you just saw her go thru the checkout.

A bunch of low iq losers and Mexicans who barely speak english work here. They lock items behind the plastic guards, but can't get assistance when it's time to get them open. The staff are incompetent and don't even know how to find items in the store - I'd literally be better off using the Walmart App to find things (which I do instead of asking someone b/c they either don't know or look at the app themselves).

I've been to Utah before and their Walmarts are infinitely better than here in Portland/Gresham. Their Walmarts had happy music playing outside, tons of staff, and the staff were atleast happy to be working the job.

Here they're either sad, depressed, 3rd world country, obese, or low iq employees.

"There was a time when the abundance of self-checkout lanes greatly enhanced the efficiency of our shopping experience. However, the significant reduction of these lanes, for reasons that remain baffling, has introduced a host of challenges.

The most notable impact has been the substantial increase in wait times. Where customers previously enjoyed swift checkouts within 2-3 minutes, they are now faced with prolonged delays of 10-15 minutes due to the limited number of available lanes and the apparent shortage of staff. This inefficiency is both inconvenient and frustrating for customers.

It is perplexing why so many self-checkout lanes were removed, especially considering their clear benefits.

"Everything in there is mostly clean, but once in a while when I pass by the produce area I see that some of the fruits and vegetables are moldy.
So I go to another store for them. It's almost spring and I think that's when people go out more often than not.
Even in prison, there's more outdoor jobs and all sorts of activities. I was in Hiland for a while and learned a few things. Getting commissary was the best part of doing time there... Especially spending time with friends. (I'd like to visit sometime soon...🗝️
The prices would change often... While I was there the prices would get higher and if you had no money on your books then they'd be miserable. So, I'd sneak some commissary to the one's who had nothing.
Recently, I started participating in the Downtown Soup Kitchen but slowly started getting distant. They are very supportive and I miss it there.
I donated: ""Imperial Dragon Jasmine Rice."" Maybe, ""If possible would you be able to help the Downtown Soup Kitchen with food and clothes?

"DON'T SHOP HERE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE AuDHD , DISABLED , SICK , OR YOUR APPEARANCE / OUTFIT ISN'T THE ""SOCIAL NORM"" If you must shop here, I'd wear a body camera to prove that you're innocent. Also zero stars.

Long story short , I'm AuDHD , physically disabled with CPTSD & PTSD types 2-4. I was profiled , ambushed, touched , harassed , followed , accused of stealing and damaging property. Two women disguised as customers surrounded me in a very small aisle. Once I realized what was going on , I felt threatened , confused , in danger & overwhelmed . I had no clear path to leave. Since this event , I have been having PTSD panic attacks , anxiety attacks , burn out and meltdowns on off for months. I'm still scared to shop at other stores.

The behavior of several employees here is disgusting. I've been : surrounded by 4+ employees multiple times for coming in with my own property (backpack to carry my groceries, my winter goat / gloves I took off due to being hot) , been chased / accused of stealing items I bought there weeks ago. I'm sick and tired of being accused of shoplifting here & being followed for wearing a mask despite the recent pandemic.

Stay safe and untraumatized my spicy autistic friends.

Dear Walmart , DO . BETTER . You can start off by PAYING YOUR EMPLOYEE'S MORE and then MAYBE they wouldn't hate their job so much and take it out on innocent , vulnerable people.

And since Walmart never got back to me, I've included a photo of the women. It's grainy and censored. It could still be helpful to get a general idea of who to avoid.

"Won’t return to this location. Went there this morning, bought some juice got out to my car to drink it noticed it looked kind of weird. I checked the expiration date and it’s been expired since June 4th. Went back into customer service and let’s just say Andrea shouldn’t be in that department because she was rude and called me a liar. Apparently the self check out machine didn’t give me the correct receipt. I said I can go back to the machine I was at and see about getting the right receipt she cut me off and said did you pay with card, I said yes! She says where is the date even on this I showed her she told me to insert the card and refunded my money. She was very very rude and dismissive.

"When I was growing up, walmart was awesome. It had everything at awesome prices. The stores looked great. Shelves were fully stocked and the employees were friendly and knowledgeable. I just don't know what to say anymore.  The employees, most of them, just seem like they have no idea how to do their job. They have almost no knowledge of the store they are employed at let alone an ounce of customer service. For every 10 employees I ask a question only 1 seems able to help. I have watched numerous employees just wandering around or looking at their phones. Forget purchasing anything in electronics because no one is ever around. Usually when I do find someone they give me the ""I don't have keys"" or "" I don't work back here"" response. I even had an employee tell me last week he hated working there and he didn't want to be there. The online order pickers will cut you off, physically, and will not try to help or even direct me to what I'm looking for. The cashiers 9 times out of 10 will not even ask if I want to purchase a bag. Instead just piling up my items and wondering why I'm still standing there.
